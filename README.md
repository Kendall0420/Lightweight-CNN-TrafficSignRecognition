# Lightweight-CNN-TrafficSignRecognition

This is a lightweight CNN based Traffic Sign Recognition system. The proposed model uses a custom CNN architecture that requires computational power several times less than the state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition algorithms.

To measure and validate the model accuracy, two different traffic sign recognition benchmark datasets are used:
